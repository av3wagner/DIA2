# Disease Diagnosis Using ML
Disease Diagnosis App
This is a machine learning-based app designed to diagnose various diseases, including COVID-19, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer's, and lung cancer. The app collects user information, such as symptoms, health history, and lifestyle habits, to provide personalized information about potential health concerns.

The app is built on Python, utilizing several popular machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The machine learning models are trained on large datasets of medical records and health-related data, allowing for accurate and reliable predictions.

### Installation
To install the app, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install Python 3.x if it is not already installed.
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.
Run python Home.py in your terminal to start the app.
#### Usage
When the app is launched, visit the desired diseases and then user will be prompted to provide information about their health history, symptoms, and lifestyle habits. The app then uses machine learning algorithms to analyze this information and predict potential health concerns.
